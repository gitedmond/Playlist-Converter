# **Playlist Converter**

This Python program offers a solution to convert your Spotify playlists into YouTube Music playlists by leveraging both Spotify's and Google's APIs.

## **Purpose**

The primary motivation behind developing this program was to address a problem I and many others likely face: the hassle of exchanging playlists between Spotify and YouTube Music. My friend had the best playlist of all time but it was on YouTube music, weird. It's a good thing I'm a computer scientist and I can streamline every single tedious task in my life with a few lines of code. 

## **How it Works**

**Spotify Playlist Conversion (`spotifyplylst.py`):**

Run `spotifyplylst.py`, which will prompt you to:
- Select a playlist from your Spotify account for conversion.
- Specify the desired name and description for the new YouTube Music playlist.

Utilizing the `subprocess` module, `spotifyplylst.py` triggers the execution of `youtubeplylst.py`.

**YouTube Music Playlist Creation (`youtubeplylst.py`):**

- After logging in with your Google account, `youtubeplylst.py` creates the YouTube Music playlist, using the title and 
  description provided.
- If any songs from the Spotify playlist are unavailable on YouTube Music, the program generates a list of these songs, 
  ensuring transparency about which tracks could not be added due to unavailability.

Please note that while Spotify offers a vast collection of songs, podcasts, and audio content, not all of these may be available on YouTube. As a result, this program helps identify and report any content that could not be added to the YouTube Music playlist.

## **Prerequisites**

Before using this program, you will need to set up your Spotify (see `spotify_api_token_gen.js`) and Google API credentials. Detailed instructions for setting up these credentials can be found in the respective documentation provided with this repository.

## **Usage**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your Spotify and Google API credentials as per the instructions.
3. Run `spotifyplylst.py` and follow the prompts to initiate the conversion process.
